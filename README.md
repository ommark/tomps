tomps: The Intentional Break Timer üçÖ
tomps isn't just another timer‚Äîit's a system designed to help you build powerful, positive habits during your breaks. We combine the focus of the Pomodoro Technique with the life-changing concept of atomic habits.

Most productivity tools focus only on the "work" part of the cycle. We believe the real magic happens in the moments in between. By making your breaks intentional, you can use those small windows of time to stretch, hydrate, learn, connect, and grow.

‚ú® Core Features (MVP)
Classic Pomodoro Timer: A clean, configurable timer for your focused work sessions (pomodoros).

Intentional Break System: At the end of each work session, you're prompted with a suggested activity to make your break meaningful.

Curated Activity Library: A pre-defined list of healthy and productive activities covering mindfulness, fitness, learning, and well-being.

Personalized Activity List: Users can browse the library and add activities to their own personal list, giving them full control over their break-time suggestions.

Smart Onboarding: New users are automatically given a "starter pack" of activities so they can get value from the very first session.

Persistent Settings: All your timer configurations and activity lists are saved to your account, so your setup is always ready for you.

üöÄ How It Works: Your First Session
Welcome to tomps! Here‚Äôs how to get started on your first productive session.

Start the Timer: The timer is set for a 25-minute focused work session. Hit "Start" and get to work on your task.

Take an Intentional Break: When the timer finishes, a modal will pop up with a suggested activity for your break (e.g., "Stretch your back and neck").

Begin Your Break: Click "Start Break" to begin your 5-minute break timer. Use this time to complete the suggested activity!

Repeat: When the break is over, the next work session begins automatically. Repeat the cycle. After four pomodoros, you'll get a longer break.

Customize Your Habits: Go to the Settings tab at any time to customize your timer durations or manage your list of break activities. Browse the Activity Library to discover and add new habits to your routine!
